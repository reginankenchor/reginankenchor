## Hi there üëã

### **‚ú® Regina Nkenchor ‚ú®**

Welcome to my GitHub! 

I‚Äôm a **software engineer** with over **10 years of experience** leading **digital transformation projects** in **tax**, **finance**, **education**, **retail**, and the **open source ecosystem**. My expertise spans **backend development**, **program and project management**, **developer relations**, **community management**, and **technical support**.

I am committed to **open source and education**, and I‚Äôve dedicated my career to supporting and building **developer communities**. I focus on creating **diverse, inclusive, and empathetic open source cultures** while improving the experience for newcomers‚Äîespecially those from underrepresented backgrounds. Leveraging **open source for social good** is a key motivator in my work.

I am the **Founder and Executive Director** of **[OpenKids Africa](https://www.openkidsafrica.org/)**, a non-profit organization focused on empowering children in African rural communities through technology and education. In less than a year, we have reached over **1,000 children** in rural schools in Nigeria. Our work was recognized globally when **OpenKids Africa** was chosen as one of the **Scratch Program 2024** members, where we are helping to support **[The Scratch Education Collaborative (SEC)](https://sip.scratch.mit.edu/sec/)**, an initiative that engages organizations worldwide in a two-year cohort to strengthen their commitment to **equitable creative computing**.

Over the years, I‚Äôve:
- **Authored 15 articles** on Open Source, OSPO, and technology  
- **Given over 20 talks üåç** at open source and technology conferences globally  
- **Hosted a podcast üé§**, inspiring more open contributions to open source through storytelling  
- **Organized over 10 events**, including recurring annual events, ranging from small meetups to large conferences  
- **Served as an OSPO Ambassador** at **IKEA**, acting as a subject matter expert, helping organizations and teams adopt open source tools  
- **Served two terms (2020‚Äì2024)** as the **Vice President of the GNOME Board of Directors** and **Operational Governance Committee Secretary and Chair**

I believe that **"soft skills"**‚Äîlike communication, empathy, and collaboration‚Äîare some of the hardest but most essential skills to master. My goal is to help **developers, communities, and businesses grow**, and in turn, create a healthier, more inclusive open source ecosystem for everyone.

In my free time, I am an **independent researcher** and a **writer**.
