## Hi there üëã

### **‚ú® Regina Nkenchor ‚ú®**

Welcome to my GitHub! 

I have over **10 years of experience in the technology industry**, including roles as a software engineer. I‚Äôve led digital transformation projects in tax, finance, and education, and am currently leading similar efforts in the retail and open source ecosystems. My expertise spans **backend development**, **program and project management**, **developer relations**, **community management**, and **technical support**.

I am committed to **open source and education**, and I‚Äôve dedicated my career to supporting and building **developer communities**. I focus on creating **diverse, inclusive, and empathetic open source cultures** while improving the experience for newcomers‚Äîespecially those from underrepresented backgrounds. Leveraging **open source for social good** is a key motivator in my work.

I am the **Founder and Executive Director** of **[OpenKids Africa](https://www.openkidsafrica.org/)**, a non-profit empowering children in rural Nigeria through technology and education. In less than a year, we‚Äôve impacted over **1,000 children**. Our work was recognized globally when we were selected for the **[Scratch Program 2024](https://sip.scratch.mit.edu/sec/)**, supporting equitable creative computing worldwide.


Over the years, I‚Äôve:
- **Authored over 15 articles** on Open Source, OSPO, and technology. 
- **Given over 20 talks üåç** at open source and technology conferences globally.  
- **Hosting a podcast üé§**, inspiring more women contributions to open source through storytelling.  
- **Organized over 10 events**, including recurring annual events, ranging from small meetups to large conferences.  
- **Serving as an OSPO Ambassador** at **IKEA**, acting as a subject matter expert, helping organizations and teams adopt open source tools.  
- **Served two terms (2020‚Äì2024)** as the vice President of the GNOME Board of Directors** and Rotational Governance Committee Secretary and Chair**

I believe that **"soft skills"**‚Äîlike communication, empathy, and collaboration‚Äîare some of the hardest but most essential skills to master. My goal is to help **developers, communities, and businesses grow**, and in turn, create a healthier, more inclusive open source ecosystem for everyone.

In my free time, I am an **independent researcher** and a **writer**.
