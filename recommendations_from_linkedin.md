# Recommendations from LinkedIn

Here are some of the recommendations I've received from colleagues and peers on LinkedIn:

---

### Michael Downey – Open Source @ United Nations Development Programme

*June 23, 2024*

I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Regina during our overlapping service as elected Directors for the GNOME Foundation. She played an important role in developing many of the concepts behind the new GNOME Pathways Initiative, which was a key part of the strategic plan the Board prepared for the GNOME community. 

Regina played a critical role as a leader in increasing opportunities for people of diverse backgrounds to feel welcome and encouraged to GNOME no matter their background or place in the world. Specifically, her work helping to support the GNOME Africa community has been particularly valuable, including her keynote about the GNOME Project at the Africa Open Source Festival in 2023. She also was a valuable asset to GNOME's participation in Google Summer of Code and Outreachy - two programs that are of immense benefit helping newcomers learn skills and confidence participating in both open source and the GNOME Project.

I strongly encourage you to get to know her and work with her in whatever opportunities may arise!

### Sriram Ramkrishna – The Interface Between You and Open Source Communities

*June 21, 2024*

I worked with Regina on a few events like Linux App Summit and GUADEC. I'd like to recommend Regina for any job – she's smart, persistent, and goal-oriented. If she sets her sights on something she will move heaven and earth to get there. She has been one of the lead architects of the African GNOME initiative and helped involve other folks from Africa and get them involved in GNOME. The ability to attract, develop, and keep volunteers in a non-profit is a valuable skill.

### Robert McQueen – CEO @ Endless OS Foundation, President @ GNOME Foundation

*June 19, 2024*

I worked closely with Regina on the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors for many years. She's always been a highly motivated, passionate, and articulate advocate for engaging diverse communities in the GNOME ecosystem. She's represented GNOME with multiple other partner organisations and conducted research into how best to incorporate diversity and inclusion programs into our strategy and fundraising plans. She's a prominent leader in the GNOME Africa community, has promoted GNOME to new audiences as well as managing programs to welcome and onboard newcomers. I highly commend and appreciate her work in this vital space and hope that GNOME will continue working with her as part of our new strategy.

### Maryam Washik – Doctoral Researcher | Informatics - Digital Innovation and Digitalization | University of Oslo

*October 16, 2021*

Regina does everything she sets her heart to do exceptionally well. She's one of the few brilliant people I know who exhibits passion, skills, and talent in her work. This applies particularly to her skills in research and development that I have had the privilege of experiencing. I highly recommend Regina as she's reliable, result-oriented, and someone who wants to see everyone succeed. She is a genuine good human all round. Everyone would want to have her on their team.
